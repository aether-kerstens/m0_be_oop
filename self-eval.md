# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
Painful. I had become comfortable with hashes, arrays, with methods, but OOP was something else entirely and I am becoming more comfortable with the material but its still a little confusing currently as it feels its slightly different with the object instances. It felt good when I overcame them but frustrating for when there's a minor syntax error that stops me from testing the code and I don't know where that syntax error is - as in it keeps changing regardless of what I do.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Workflow is good, though remembering to take breaks is the hardest part currently as I get subsumed into focus and work.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to do more practice, focus on concentration, and spend more time with my group/team as working alone can cause me to get stuck in a loop. Also the mentor/tutors will be a great amount of help.
